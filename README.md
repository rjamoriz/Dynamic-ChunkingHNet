# 🚀 H-Net Dynamic Chunking Implementation

A comprehensive implementation of the H-Net Dynamic Chunking algorithm for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, based on the research paper "Dynamic Chunking for Retrieval-Augmented Generation".

## 📖 Overview

This project implements the H-Net (Hierarchical Network) dynamic chunking algorithm that adaptively segments text based on semantic boundaries rather than fixed-size chunks. The implementation demonstrates significant improvements in semantic coherence and boundary detection precision.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 H-Net Architecture**: Complete implementation of the hierarchical encoder-main-decoder structure
- **🎯 Dynamic Boundary Detection**: Cosine similarity-based semantic boundary identification
- **🔄 Routing Module**: Adaptive chunk creation based on compression ratios
- **📊 Smoothing Module**: Exponential moving average for gradient flow stability
- **📈 Interactive Visualizations**: Apache ECharts integration for professional data visualization
- **⚖️ Comprehensive Evaluation**: Quality metrics and performance comparison tools
- **🎨 Rich Analysis**: Multiple visualization types including heatmaps, radar charts, and dashboards

## 🏗️ Architecture

The H-Net dynamic chunking system consists of:

1. **Similarity-Based Boundary Detector**: Identifies semantic boundaries using cosine similarity
2. **Routing Module**: Creates variable-size chunks based on boundary probabilities
3. **Smoothing Module**: Applies exponential moving average for training stability
4. **Quality Metrics**: Evaluates semantic coherence and boundary precision
5. **Interactive Visualizations**: Professional charts using Apache ECharts

## 🔬 Research Foundation

This implementation is based on the research paper:
- **Title**: "Dynamic Chunking for Retrieval-Augmented Generation"
- **arXiv**: 2507.07955
- **Key Innovation**: Hierarchical network architecture for adaptive text segmentation

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Boundary Detection Algorithm
```python
# Cosine similarity-based boundary detection
similarity = cosine_similarity(embeddings[i], embeddings[i+1])
boundary_prob = 1.0 - similarity
```

### Routing Mechanism
```python
# Dynamic chunk creation based on compression ratio
target_chunk_size = total_tokens / compression_ratio
adaptive_threshold = calculate_adaptive_threshold(boundary_probs)
```

### Quality Metrics
- **Semantic Boundary Score**: Measures respect for sentence boundaries
- **Compression Ratio**: Tokens per chunk efficiency
- **Boundary Precision**: F1 score for boundary detection accuracy
- **Chunk Size Variance**: Consistency measure
