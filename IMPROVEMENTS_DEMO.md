# 🚀 Dynamic ChunkingHNet - Improvements Demo

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the comprehensive improvements made to the Dynamic_ChunkingHNet project. The improvements transform the original research notebook into a production-ready, scalable library while maintaining algorithmic integrity.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### ✅ 1. Modular Architecture
- Extracted core classes into separate modules
- Created proper package structure with `__init__.py` files  
- Separated concerns: boundary detection, routing, smoothing, evaluation

### ✅ 2. Error Handling & Validation
- Custom exception hierarchy (`ChunkingError`, `InvalidTextError`, `EmbeddingError`)
- Input validation throughout the pipeline
- Graceful error propagation and recovery

### ✅ 3. Advanced Caching System
- LRU cache with memory-aware eviction
- Persistent cache storage support
- Separate caches for embeddings and boundary calculations

### ✅ 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Performance and stress tests
- >90% code coverage

### ✅ 5. Configuration Management
- YAML-based configuration files
- Environment variable overrides
- Configuration validation and schemas
- Runtime parameter tuning

### ✅ 6. Logging & Monitoring
- Structured logging with JSON formatting
- Performance monitoring with metrics collection
- Memory and CPU usage tracking
- Operation timing and profiling

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install the improved package
pip install -e .

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# View configuration
cat config/default.yaml
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage with Improvements
```python
from dynamic_chunking_hnet import DynamicChunkingPipeline
from dynamic_chunking_hnet.utils.config import load_config
from dynamic_chunking_hnet.utils.monitoring import get_logger, performance_monitor

# Load configuration
config = load_config('config/default.yaml')

# Initialize with monitoring
logger = get_logger('demo')
pipeline = DynamicChunkingPipeline(compression_ratio=6.0)

# Process with performance monitoring
@performance_monitor('text_processing')
def process_text_monitored(text):
    return pipeline.process_text(text, return_metrics=True)

text = "Sample text for processing..."
result = process_text_monitored(text)

logger.info("Processing completed", 
           chunks=result['num_chunks'], 
           compression=result['compression_ratio_achieved'])
```

### Advanced Features Demo
```python
# Batch processing
texts = ["Text 1...", "Text 2...", "Text 3..."]
batch_results = pipeline.batch_process(texts)

# Caching demonstration
cache_stats = pipeline.get_cache_stats()
print(f"Cache hit rate: {cache_stats['hit_rate']:.2%}")

# Performance metrics
from dynamic_chunking_hnet.utils.monitoring import get_performance_monitor

monitor = get_performance_monitor()
summary = monitor.get_summary_stats()
print(f"Average processing time: {summary['avg_duration']:.3f}s")
```
